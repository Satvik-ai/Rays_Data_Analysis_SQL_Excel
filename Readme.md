## Rays Data Analysis Using SQl & Excel

<p> A data analyst portfolio project that utilizes both Excel and SQL. The goal of the project is to run some initial analysis on data for last pitches for the Tampa Bay Rays. </p>

Data Source :- https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search 
Data Docs :- https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs

<p> I downloaded the data from the data source and cleaned it using excel. Cleaning involved deleting the columns which were not required and filling the missing values. </p>

<p> After cleaning, I loaded it on the sqlite database and performed analysis on it by executing some sql queries. </p>
